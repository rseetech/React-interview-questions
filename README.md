3. ### Features of React

   1. JSX : JSX is an extension to javascript. Though it is not mandatory to use JSX in react, it is one of the good features and easy to use.

   2. Components: Components are like pure javascript functions that help make the code easy by splitting the logic into reusable independent code. We can use components as functions and components as classes. Components also have a state, props which makes life easy. Inside a class, the state of each of the props is maintained.
   
   3. Virtual DOM: React creates a virtual dom, i.e., in-memory data -structure cache. Only the final changes of DOM has later updated in the browsers DOM.

   4. Javascript Expressions: JS expressions can be used in the jsx files using curly brackets, for example {}.
